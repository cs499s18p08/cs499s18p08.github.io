<h3> Testing </h3>
	<br>
	***Disclaimer: We haven't been able to properly test the platform on an IOS platform due to limitation of not having easy access to a MAC. 
	To test our app on an IOS device we need have access to a MAC.***
	<br>
	The main goal of this product is to have a mobile app that allows people to have reference material readily avaiable to them through a database provided by our Client.
	along with that we will allow the user to log in and fill out a lot of information that will be saved to the database. The information they collect will be about the information about the accident they're investigating.
