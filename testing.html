<h3> Testing </h3>
	<br>
	The main goal of this product is to have a mobile app that allows people to have reference material readily avaiable to them through a database provided by our Client.
	along with that we will allow the user to log in and fill out a lot of information that will be saved to the database. The information they collect will be about the information about the accident they're investigating.
	Everything besides the reference material pages is not on the lite version of the app, but on the full version.
	<br>

	<h3>System Testing</h3>
		<h4>Tools/Language used</h4>
		The language that was used in coding this app was React Native.
		The tools that were used were Android Studio and Sublime to write our code in and the Emulator was through Android studio to emulate the phone.
		<h4>Android Testing</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>This has been throughly tested through an android emulation app. All the functionality of the app besides the camera works fine on an android phone.</li>
				<li>It has been tested on multiple different types of android phones through emulation and functions perfectly fine.</li>
				<li>We have run the app on our own android phones, not through the emulator and it functions exactly how it does during the emulation.</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>IOS Testing</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Tested on several different I-phones. All of the functionality of the app works on the iphone. The reference material pages that we pushed to the app store all work as intended and there are no diffrences in performance compared to Android</li>
			</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>Customer Testing (user-based)</h3>
		The customer testing will be handled most likely by our client when he shows it off at the conference he is going to in May. He wants to unveil what all three groups have been working on at the conference
		and possibly show other people who're interested in the progress it has made and potentially what is in store for future plans.
		<h4>Types of possible tests</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Testing if the UI that has been made is easy to follow and everyone can understand it.</li>
			<li>Testing if there is complete functionality within the fields of the app. Such fields include text inputs, drop down menus and navigation.</li>
			<li>Ensuring that there is possibility for future expansion on the project.</li>
			<li>Making sure the database functionality works completely fine across the mobile and desktop application.</li>
		</ul>
