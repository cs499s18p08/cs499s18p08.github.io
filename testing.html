<h3> Testing </h3>
	<br>
	The main goal of this product is to have a mobile app that allows people to have reference material readily avaiable to them through a database provided by our Client.
	along with that we will allow the user to log in and fill out a lot of information that will be saved to the database. The information they collect will be about the information about the accident they're investigating.

	<h3>Customer Testing (user-based)</h3>
		The customer testing will be handled most likely by our client when he shows it off at the conference he is going to in May. He wants to unveil what all three groups have been working on at the conference
		and possibly show other people who're interested in the progress it has made and potentially what is in store for future plans.
		<h4>Types of possible tests</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Testing if the UI that has been made is easy to follow and everyone can understand it.</li>
			<li>Testing if there is complete functionality within the fields of the app. Such fields include text inputs, drop down menus and navigation.</li>
			<li>Ensuring that there is possibility for future expansion on the project.</li>
			<li>Making sure the database functionality works completely fine across the mobile and desktop application.</li>
		</ul>
