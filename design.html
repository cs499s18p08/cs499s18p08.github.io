<h3> Design </h3>

	<div>
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	
		<ul>
			<li> Save New Job data created by user to server</li>
			<li> Search vehicle database (already owned by company)</li>
			<li> Search reference material database (data has been acquired by company) </li>
			<li> Navigate to create a new job, access reference materials, and access the vehicle 
				database through the sidemenu </li>
			<li> Allow for the collection of GPS coordinates for geo-referencing </li> 
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
	<h3> Environment </h3>
		The application will be designed using React-Native, an open source framework backed by Facebook. 
		We are using Marshmallow, an Android Emulator, along with google APIs. 
The emulator is built and processed byan IDE called Gradle. This allows us to simulate a virtual mobile
		device and test how the mobile application will workas we build it. All of this will be done using Windows 10.
