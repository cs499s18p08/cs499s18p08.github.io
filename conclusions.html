<h3> Conclusions </h3>
	
	<div>
		The changes we encountered in the project were mainly beneficial to our progress. We initially had very lofty, ambitious goals but over time we learned to scale those goals back to something more managable and take into account the other teams that were ultimately key to our success. A huge part of the initial plan was a functional create and edit portion of the app for crashes and interfacing those with the cloud database. By the time we had access to the database it was too late in the semester to interface that with the actual UI that we had created. We instead focused on implementing reference materials and ensuring those look professional on both Android and iOS. Ultimately this was a lot more managable and led to us having a successful lite app as opposed to an incomplete "full" app.

		We encountered a lot of issues surrounding emulation off the app. One of our teammates only had an AMD processor which is not compatable with the emulator for Android and in order to develop on iOS you need to have a Mac in order to build and emulate the app. Additionally with React Native as a language there is a hefty learning curve. The way the framework is design is very different than other languages any of us had encounter so we all had to learn how to think in terms of React. Finally one of the huge things yet again was the database. Even after we got access to the table we had to create communications between the app and the cloud. This required us to create a server for the app to talk to through url calls that was hosting out the tables.

		We learned a lot on this project. One of the main things being how to interact and communicate with a customer's needs. In class a project normally has a very set, static list of requirements that can only be gone about a small handful of ways. However, when working with a client the requirements change often. Aspects of the product need to be tweaked or reworked so that it works with the client's true vision. I think we also had to learn how to estimate our time and abilities better. We had large goals to start with but throughout the project we learned that we were more capable than we thought in some regards and less capable in others. These were all important for our client and our own goals throughout the project and will certainly be something that we can take to future projects and endeavors.

		Overall this project was a huge success. With the time we were given we achieved a lot and set a very solid foundation for future teams. Although only the reference materials are visible currently, there is an entire UI for the add jobs and job hub page that only needs PHP pages and some adjustment to be pushed to production. Without the possibility of pushing the database team to give us earlier access to the database I do not think there is anything that we would do differently.
