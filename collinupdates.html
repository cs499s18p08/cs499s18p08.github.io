	<h3> Week 7: 3/11/18</h3>
		Earlier this week was incredibly busy with midterms in other classes. So I wasn't able to work on the project until Tuesday night. I worked with Malik to make our
		designs more uniform and look better overall. We had our meeting with Presentation U at 6pm on Wednesday. Malik, Nick and I went to it. Ben was unable to make it 
		beacause he had an exam in Physics at 7pm that day. The presentation went smoothly and we got critique from the person who we had a meeting with. We didn't have a
		meeting with our client Mike this week because we were busying prepping for the midterm presentation in CS499 and other various midterms that each group member was
		dealing with. We met up again on Thursday and did another practice run with our presentation which went smoothly as well. On Friday we had our midterm presentation.
		The presentation went well, we were a bit short on time because the other groups before us took a while and didn't leave us with much time, but it went well overall.

	<h3> Week 6: 3/4/18 </h3>
		
	This week all 3 teams met together with Mike on monday to discuss what the plans moving forward are and how the progress on each part is going. Also it help set up a better
		way for us to contact eachother for how things are going and make the communication between groups better. The plan moving forward was that the mobile
		and desktop team are to get the reference material working as soon as possible as the highest priority in stuff that needs to get working. For the app I finished
		the part I needed to get done and as a group we met with Mike on Wednesday at our usual time at 7pm. We showed him what we had and our plans for the upcoming week
		which was mostly to work on the midterm presentation and get the app looking more uniform. So we set up our meeting with Presentation U for Wednesday at 6pm. We 
		also met up and discussed who needs to work on what for updating the website and whos going to help set up the presentation. Today on sunday we all met up as a 
		group and planned out the presentation and finished up what was needed for the website. I work on the description for each of the pages that were in the app.

	<h3> Week 5: 2/25/18 </h3>
		
	This week was a more productive week. I was able to learn a lot about react native. I spend a majority of my time Sunday, Monday and Tuesday learning
		about react native and how everything works on it. I was also able to finish the initial designs for the settings and personal notes page for our
		app. On Wednesday we had our meeting with Mike and that went really well. He liked the app that we showed it. It was only the skelaton app, but it
		had navigation working, but had a few blank pages that we proceeded to work on more after the meeting. On Sunday today I worked on finishing the
		layout of the pages I was given: Settings, Personal notes, and Occupational Information. I was able to get most of the layouts of the pages finished.
		There isn't to much left for me to do besides finish a few more drop down menus and get the correct colors for the pages since they aren't exactly what was
		specified to us at the moment.

	<h3> Week 4: 2/18/18 </h3>
	
	This week started off fairly chaotic and I wasn't really able to work on anything till Wednesday where we finalized the design for the project. We met 
		met with Mike on google hangouts. We talked with him about the design and added the final touches to it, but we figured out exactly what we wanted
		it to look like. We then talked to him about goals that we could set for this week. We set our goal to try to get a working skeleton app working
		Something that followed the designed, but didn't have any of the functions really working yet. I personally took notes of everything that Mike 
		wanted us to change and possibly add. 
	<br>
	Later on in the week I started looking at more stuff in react native and started to learn how to code certain things that could be beneficial to the project.
		I spent part of Thursday working on it, but mostly spent my entire Sunday working on the Skelaton app and improving my understanding of react native.
		On Monday we are getting together as a group to finish up the Skelaton app so we can show it to Mike on Wednesday. If not we will show him what we have done.

	<h3> Week 3 and before 2/11/18 </h3>
	To start off the journey I met with my team, the mobile development team, and the other teams that we'll be working with on this project.
		We then set up a communication line between us through a program called slack where we can exchange information with eachother.
		We also met our client Mike Flamm where we hashed out the initial requirement and what he really is looking for in this project.
		We exchanged information to keep in contact with him and set things up through Slack, Google Hangouts and Github
	<br>
	We met up as a team the following Monday after getting our requirement and decided that we were going to be using an android emulator to code our project on.
		Nick helped Ben, Malik and I set it up on our computers. On the android emulator we agreed to use React Native to code on
		and the client agreed to this.
	<br>
	Last Wednesday we had our most previous group meeting where Ben and I worked on seperate designs for the mobile application. We decided to
		use Ben's design, but I thought of some improvments that we could do to it such as ease of access or just move some stuff around.
		We then had our next meeting with Mike over google hangouts. We showed him our current design and suggestions that we could and compared 
		it to his design. He critiqued our a bit, but overall he really liked it. We then decided to set the time to meet him was 7pm on Wednesdays.
		We also set our goal for the week was to finalize the design and start working on the skelaton for the app.
	<br>
	Lastly I started working within React Native to understand how it works. I also started to learn the language that is being coded in it
		to help myself when it comes to when we start to code the actual assignment.
