		<h3>Update 1 - 2/11/18</h3>
			Our group began by meeting with our client, Mike Flamm, to discuss the goals of the mobile application.  Our group decided to use React-Native as our platform through which we would build the application.  After our meeting with Mike, we had a group meeting where we all installed the software for React-Native so we could get started with learning how the platform works.
			Next we decided to come up with a design for the project, and develop the website for the project.  Collin and I would work on the design, while Nick and Malik worked on the website.  The design I came up with was a flowchart that went through each different screen of the app and how they functioned.  The idea was to make it simple to follow.  I used draw.io (a freeware web editor from Google) to create a flowchart of the design.  Collin came up with some ideas to implement and modify my design.  We then met with Mike on Wednesday, February 7th to discuss the design.  Mike liked the design, but gave us some criticism on additional features he wanted that we had not put in the app.  With these ideas in mind, I began to modify the design to fulfill these criticisms.
			Finally, I looked into some of the React-Native software to familiarize myself with it.  I wanted to be prepared once we began to code the application.

		<h3>Update 2 - 2/18/18</h3>
			This week I finished the design for the application.  I expanded, and removed some features for a better flow to make the overall feel of the app work well.  Below is a flow chart of the application design.

			During our weekly meeting, Mike said he liked our design and that we should move forward with it.  We discussed acquisition of some of the data through barcodes readers.  We also decided that including Google/Facebook login for the application should be neglected as it would be potentially hazardous for the sensitive information.
			Lastly, our group met where we tried to make some skeleton framwork for the application.  I was able to create a mock Login screen for the application which did not have any major functionality, but it did lay some groundwork for the actual screen.

		<h3>Update 3 - 2/26/18</h3>
			This week we focused on a skeleton app for the base design.  I made pages for the reference pages, home screen, and login screen.  Nick focused on the pgae navigation.  Malik, and Collin focused on other pages that provided difference auxillary functions for the app.  The overall idea was to have something visual for Mike to see and approve of.  
			When we met with Mike, he like what we have come up with.  We updated him with our goals for the next week so that he would know what we were to work on next.  
			This week, we will be working on the functionality of the app. This does not include saving information, or sending data to the database.  Once we have most of the UI working, we can focus on linking it all to the database.

		<h3>Update 4 - 3/4/18</h3>
			This week, all three parts of the total project met to discuss the overall framework of the communication between the database with the desktop and mobile platforms.  We all met with Mike on campus so that he could listen in on what needed to be done.  The plan is to have database connection within the next two weeks.  
			For this week, we have been focused on getting functionality for most of the pieces of our app with placeholders for the code.  The idea is that we can fully use the application without any database connection.  Nick worked on some navigation framework and the drawer menu.  Collin and Malik worked on the data collection pages.  I worked on getting camera functionality into the app.  To do so, I have chosen to use a camera package made to work with React-Native.  This camera package took a while to figure out to get installed properly. I wasn't able to get the funtionality to work yet because of the difficulty of the installation.  Luckily, I was able to get it installed so I can finally begin implementing the functionality for the camera. 
			The camera package also includes some additional functionalities such as a barcode reader, and a camera roll framework.  Both of these functions will be useful in other portions of our application.

		<h3>Update 5 - 3/19/18</h
			This week was rather uneventful because of spring break.  I did some researching into the Amazon Web Services link for our app so that we could actually get the two working in sync together.  I also did more work on getting the camera functionality to work.nec
			While I was away, Nick, Collin, and Malik met with Mike to discuss the app. Mike told them that he wants functionality of the references material pages working first and foremost.  This requires a solid connection with the database so that we can get the data we want shown on the app.
