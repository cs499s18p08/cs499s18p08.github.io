		<h3>Update 1 - 2/11/18</h3>
			Our group began by meeting with our client, Mike Flamm, to discuss the goals of the mobile application.  Our group decided to use React-Native as our platform through which we would build the application.  After our meeting with Mike, we had a group meeting where we all installed the software for React-Native so we could get started with learning how the platform works.
			Next we decided to come up with a design for the project, and develop the website for the project.  Collin and I would work on the design, while Nick and Malik worked on the website.  The design I came up with was a flowchart that went through each different screen of the app and how they functioned.  The idea was to make it simple to follow.  I used draw.io (a freeware web editor from Google) to create a flowchart of the design.  Collin came up with some ideas to implement and modify my design.  We then met with Mike on Wednesday, February 7th to discuss the design.  Mike liked the design, but gave us some criticism on additional features he wanted that we had not put in the app.  With these ideas in mind, I began to modify the design to fulfill these criticisms.
			Finally, I looked into some of the React-Native software to familiarize myself with it.  I wanted to be prepared once we began to code the application.

		<h3>Update 2 - 2/18/18</h3>
			This week I finished the design for the application.  I expanded, and removed some features for a better flow to make the overall feel of the app work well.  Below is a flow chart of the application design.

			During our weekly meeting, Mike said he liked our design and that we should move forward with it.  We discussed acquisition of some of the data through barcodes readers.  We also decided that including Google/Facebook login for the application should be neglected as it would be potentially hazardous for the sensitive information.
			Lastly, our group met where we tried to make some skeleton framwork for the application.  I was able to create a mock Login screen for the application which did not have any major functionality, but it did lay some groundwork for the actual screen.

		<h3>Update 3 - 2/26/18</h3>
			This week we focused on a skeleton app for the base design.  I made pages for the reference pages, home screen, and login screen.  Nick focused on the pgae navigation.  Malik, and Collin focused on other pages that provided difference auxillary functions for the app.  The overall idea was to have something visual for Mike to see and approve of.  
			When we met with Mike, he like what we have come up with.  We updated him with our goals for the next week so that he would know what we were to work on next.  
			This week, we will be working on the functionality of the app. This does not include saving information, or sending data to the database.  Once we have most of the UI working, we can focus on linking it all to the database.
		</div>

		<h3>Update 4 - 3/4/18</h3>
			This week, all three parts of the total project met to discuss the overall framework of the communication between the database with the desktop and mobile platforms.  We all met with Mike on campus so that he could listen in on what needed to be done.  The plan is to have database connection within the next two weeks.  
			For this week, we have been focused on getting functionality for most of the pieces of our app with placeholders for the code.  The idea is that we can fully use the application without any database connection.  Nick worked on some navigation framework and the drawer menu.  Collin and Malik worked on the data collection pages.  I worked on getting camera functionality into the app.  To do so, I have chosen to use a camera package made to work with React-Native.  This camera package took a while to figure out to get installed properly. I wasn't able to get the funtionality to work yet because of the difficulty of the installation.  Luckily, I was able to get it installed so I can finally begin implementing the functionality for the camera. 
			The camera package also includes some additional functionalities such as a barcode reader, and a camera roll framework.  Both of these functions will be useful in other portions of our application.

		<h3>Update 5 - 3/19/18</h3>
			This week was rather uneventful because of spring break.  I did some researching into the Amazon Web Services link for our app so that we could actually get the two working in sync together.  I also did more work on getting the camera functionality to work.
			While I was away, Nick, Collin, and Malik met with Mike to discuss the app. Mike told them that he wants functionality of the references material pages working first and foremost.  This requires a solid connection with the database so that we can get the data we want shown on the app.
		</div>
	
		<div>
		<h3>Update 6 - 3/25/18</h3>
			This week, we focused heavily on the database-mobile connection.  Since we are coming up on the end of the project, we find that we must focus most of our effort towards this.  Malik and Nick focused on researching the functionality, while Collin and I focused more on getting some of the UI working on the mobile end.  
			During this time, I was able to get one our main display function to work properly for the vehcile data page.  This page calls for a dropdown menu where you select how many vehicles were involved in a crash.  Based on the number selected, the page will automatically populate the information inputs for each vehicle.  One issue in implementing this is that our conditional render does not assign different input values for the text entry/dropdown fields.  So the variables for acquiring the data must be changed to account for this.  It wasn't too difficult, but the text entry fields needed the addition of the iteration value for the condition.  So now, each box will not have the same input value for each vehicle fields.  While the text entry fields had a simple fix, the dropdown menus are a bit different.  Currently, the issue has not been resolved, but I am still looking into a fix.  Since this method of input is used for both the vehicle data and the occupant data, these functions can be added to the other page as well once all issues have been resolved.

		<h3>Update 7 - 4/1/18</h3>
			This week, we devoted all efforts toward the database integration.  There is an issue where React-Native doesn't have a standard way of accessing a MySQL database on Amazon Web Services.  So we have been looking into work arounds for the issue to prevent having to change the way the database is set up.  There are a few options that we can look into, and our last resort is to move data to another host.  
			We also made our test cases for the application to make sure that the functionality we have will continue to work.  Finally, we have been looking into how we will push our application to the iOS store, and Google play so that Mike will be able to download the app on his phone.  We are hoping to get the app through their systems within the next couple weeks.

		<h3>Update 8- 4/8/18 </h3>
			This week, we worked on the reference material pages.  These pages consist of a set of pickers that return values from the database on screen for the user based on his picks in the pickers.  We mostly focused on the conditional rendering for each page down so that the picker values would change based on what information was put into the previous picker.  Conditional rendering for these pages consists of various if-else if statements which get the value of the last picker and check what it is.  From there, the logic works through the conditions.  
			Next, we had to pass this information to the database to grab the values. Malik focused on writing some PHP pages stored on the database which would pull the values and query the database.  We have not yet managed to render the data on the page yet, but we hope to get that done within the next few days.  
			Nick focused on the speed of impact calculator and the vehicle search page for the reference material page.  The vehicle search page will get values from the user of the type of vehicle, and then print information at the final screen.  This page will be able to display information for cars back from 1936 to the present.
		</div>

		<h3>Update 9 - 4/15/18 </h3>
			This week, we used our time to finish out what was left of the reference material pages.  Collin and I managed to fix the final bugs, and get all the logic for each page to work.  Malik finished the PHP pages, and we were ready to pull data.  At first, we had trouble displaying the values because they were in JSON format.  I had looked around to find a solution but had no luck.  Initially, I had thought to push these final values to another page for display.  When Nick took a look at the code, he realized how to properly format the data and render it.  It turns out it is only a simple text render.  
			Malik used this time to also add search buttons to send a query to the database.  Once we were sure that the data was being pulled properly, we formatted all the buttons to be uniform, and then formatted the text render for the data.  Next week, we plan to finish ironing any left over bugs, formatting for iOS, and then pushing to Google Play.  We are hoping to push to the App Store for iOS soon.

		<h3>Update 10 - 4/22/18 </h3>
			This week, Nick and I ironed out the rest of the bugs in the Android version of the app.  Once this was completed, him and I pushed the first version of the 'Lite' app to the Google Play Store.  After encountering some issues with it that Mike wanted change, we fixed these issues and pushed an update to the Store.  Mike was satified with these changes, and with that we began attempting to add functionality for the iOS side.  
			We found an npm library which integrates our code into iOS, which formats the pickers correctly.  Using this code, we have begun to add this functionality to our 'Lite' app which will be pushed to the App store when all of this functionality is completed.
