	<h2> Week 4: </h2>
		<p>At the beginning of this week I spent a majority of my time attempting to locate a good OAuth 2.0 package. I am keeping my hands off the skeleton app for the time being since I have already coded something very similar to it and the other team members wish to use that development time as practice for harder portions of the code later in the assignment that they fear they wouldn’t be prepared for without the necessary baby steps. I agree with them and so I found several libraries, however, in our weekly meeting on Wednesday with Mike we reviewed the app design that Ben made based off data that recorded from meetings or Mike’s messages. While going over the app design he slashed the idea after speaking with the database team and they said it may be unsecure since if someone can get into the user’s Facebook then they have access to the app. </p>
		<p>After that idea was shot down I worked mainly on the website for the class. I implemented a password since the site contains some sensitive information to DeltaV. I also edited some general site information and tested the site to ensure the password was function the way I intended it to. </p>

	<h2> Beginning to the end of week 3: </h2>
		<p> Initially after receiving the mobile design assignment we quickly brainstormed some different kinds of software and ideas that we would be wanting to implement with the app. I have experience writing an app in a framework called React Native which specializes in making apps that work on both Android and iOS, so I suggested it to the group. We quickly took to the idea and we are now developing our project in React Native. </p>
		<p> At the end of our initial in class meeting after our project assignment we decided that since I was most familiar with React Native that I would be a good fit for the team liaison/leader. Due to this position, these past weeks I have established contact with Mr. Flamm to confirm the initial meeting in class. At that meeting we talked about his desires for the app, its target audience and how we could best design its UI for the target audience. I took minutes of the meeting that we had and posted them for our group later. Additionally, as liaison, I took time to explain the different websites and software that we would be using such as GitHub and how that would work from a security and administrative standpoint. Further I set up a good set time for us to meet weekly and coordinated details of the first online skype meeting. </p>
		<p> Between our first in class meeting with Mr. Flamm and our skype meeting I worked with the other team member to get React Native on their devices since I was familiar with the software and discovered issues with Malik’s desktop that wouldn’t allow him to download the AVD Manager which would run the Android Emulator. We ended up loaning him a spare laptop for the project and that issue should be resolved shortly. I also worked to ensure that all team members were added to the Slack, GitHub pages, and Google Hangouts chat with Mike. </p>
		<p> Also during this time, I worked with Malik on the website for the class. Malik worked mainly on the design of the site and I inputted the textual information and descriptions of the pages along with ensuring that the site was running in the new GitHub account’s webpage. I also ensured that all team members understood GitHub enough to upload their weekly updates and that they had access to the directory. </p>
		<p> Finally, although I was not able to attend the first skype meeting that I helped set up the details before due to a prior obligation I received the notes that the other team members wrote and set a goal for next week to research OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook Logins that Mike suggested would be a good idea. </p>
